- consider whether it would be simpler to change design to:
  - ingest, join, and write to tfrecord as is already done.
    this can still be first step in a pipeline.
  - then use tfx.v1.components.ImportExampleGen to
    read in the tfrecords and handle the splits.
- finish the rest of the pipeline
  as agile stories and tasks and implement them...
