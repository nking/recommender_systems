possibly 2 problems:
   when the CWD is not the same as the target script directory,
   there can be problems with importing sibling scripts in
   same directory, because the 'same directory' is interpreted
   as the CWD
   - pytinit.ini seems to address this, but there may be a problem
     with me putting src scripts in a directory called python because
     the __init__.py presence then assumes "python" is the module
     name, and that may be protected.
     ==> I'll add a package name to the source and test trees
         and adjust the code for them
         ==> movie_lens_tfx
