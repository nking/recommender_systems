NOT COMPLETE YET


see library versions compatible with tfx 1.16.0
#see dependencies https://github.com/tensorflow/transform
those are installed to a conda virtual environment based on python 3.10

to create a virtual environment to install the TFX compatible
libraries, can use conda or virtualenv.
(1) for conda, 
  see: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nicholeasuniquename/a-virtual-environment-w-earlier-version-of-python
(2) for virtualenv
  python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
  python3 -m virtualenv -p python3.10 /path/to/envs/python_310_tfx
  source /path/to/envs/python_310_tfx/bin/activate
  
the virtual environments are activated within a shell, and are not
currently selectable in the Kaggle notebook 
after ipykernel install and register.  The kernels are selectable
in Google Cloud jupyter notebooks (in Vertex AI workbenches)
and presumably in AWS SageMaker Studio notebooks, and Azure ML Studio.

Once within a shell using activated virtual env having python 3.10:

if not using kaggle, make sure your platform glibxx libraries are
updated because pyfarmhash needs GLIBCXX_3.4.32
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall libstdc++6
can find the versions with:
    strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX | grep 32
if you do not see 3.4.32 within that list, then do the same "strings" check
on the host system (not virtual env).  
if not found there either, try to update the host system similarly for 
libstdc++6.
if have 3.4.32 within the host system list, you can use this to copy over
the more complete host library:
   cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 ~/miniconda3/envs/tfx_py310/lib/

Then, the activated virtual environment needs these packages:

pip -q install pyarrow==10.0.1
pip -q install apache-beam==2.59.0
pip -q install tensorflow==2.16.1
pip -q install tensorflow-transform==1.16.0
pip -q install tfx==1.16.0
pip -q install tensorflow-data-validation==1.16.0
pip -q install pytest

============= 
Miscellaneous project information:

ingest components:

  Two custom components were made to choose from:
  1) a python function custom component:
    MovieLensExampleGen from ingest_movie_lens_component.py
  2) a fully custom component:
    IngestMovieLensComponent from ingest_movie_lens_custom_component.py

=======

setup.py is used because need to package the ingest component with
all of its sibling imports for the pipeline.

in project base directory, within activated virtual environment:
  pip install --editable . 

local testing, no CI/CD yet (pipeline uses scripts...):
  pycharm:
    using right click menu, mark the source tree directory:
      src/main/python
    using right click menu, mark the test tree directory:
      src/test/python/movie_lens_tfx
    then pycharm tests will correctly resolve paths.
  bash or other shell environment:
    python and pytest can be used from the project's base
    directory
