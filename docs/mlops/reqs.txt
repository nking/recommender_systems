goal of the recommender systems notebook:
  - ability to predict what user's would like to see and have not already seen
    in the moviews inventory.

goal of the refactoring:
  - refactor the code to use modular custom python functions in TFX pipelines 
    for MLOps pipeline

---------------------------------------

place the code for recommender systems into TFX components to make a 
pipeline which is runnable by a local spark runner.

consider writing a pipeline with placeholders for iteration, approval, and
deployment.

code should be efficient and easy to maintain and modify with knowledge of
TFX and some knowledge of Apache-Beam.
