are there aspects of these movie views that can be recast as forecasting
problems?
    trends by genre?
  - a look at popularity of genres as a time series

low priority to put on future todo list:
- consider improving the zipcode to timezone translations by using zcta
  to get zipcode regional boundaries.  then calculate centroids and use a library
  to transform the coordinates to time zone

consider putting the original transformations into a script that uses Polars
  instead of Pandas and also uses PySpark and Fugue.
  very efficient for a desktop local run.  would be interesting to compare
  to TFX + Spark runner

consider improving the zipcodes to use ZCTA .. 
  census has a database of zip codes mapped to geographic boundaries 
  can get centroid of them and then time zone.
  consider also using the 2010 database for the failied 2020 lookups.
