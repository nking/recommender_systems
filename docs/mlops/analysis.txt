libraries:
  - apache-beam
  - TFX

TFX is not available for all architectures.  e.g. apple arm m4 pro.

TFX is compatible with a restricted range of python and tensorflow.
see https://pypi.org/project/tfx/

place the code for recommender systems into TFX components to make a 
pipeline which is runnable by a local spark runner.

considering custom python functions and using the TFX dsl annotations.

TFXIO might be useful for transforming data into tfrecords.

tf.Transform methods that make a pass through all of the data are needed 
to count records and to define vocabularies, else the operations are 
parallelizable in pre-processing..

consider writing a pipeline with placeholders for iteration, approval, and
deployment.

would like to use the custom python functions with dsl annotations

also create the compiler statements needed to create the yaml intermediate file
